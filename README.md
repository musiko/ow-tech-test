# Backend Engineering Task: Copilot Credit Usage API

A FastAPI repository for calculating the credit usage of a billing period for OW Copilot service.

## Getting Started

1. Open a terminal window and [clone this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
2. Choose your preferred method to setup and run the application:
    - [Run with venv](#1-run-with-venv)
    - [Run with Docker](#2-run-with-docker)
3. Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` in your browser to view the API documentation. (replace `8000` with your port number if you changed it)

## Setup

### 1. Run with venv

#### 1.1 Prerequisite
- Python 3.12+

### 1.2. Setup

1. In the terminal window, navigate to the root directory of this repository and create a virtual environment:
```
python3 -m venv venv
```

2. Activate the virtual environment with:
```
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies from requirements.txt file:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 1.3. Running the Application

Location of command execution: `backend/`

| Command | Description |
|-----------|-----------|
| `fastapi run app/main.py` | Run the backend application in development mode with port 8000 |
| `fastapi run app/main.py --port={PORT}` | Run the backend application in production mode with port {PORT} |
| `fastapi dev app/main.py` | Run the backend application in development mode with port 8000 |
| `fastapi dev app/main.py --port={PORT}` | Run the backend application in production mode with port {PORT} |
| `pytest` | Run tests |


### 2. Run With Docker

#### 2.1 Prerequisite
- Docker Engine

### 2.2. Setup

1. In the terminal window, navigate to the root directory of this repository.

2. (Optional) If you need to change the port of the application, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update it with your own values.

2. Run this docker command to build docker image(s):
```
docker compose build
```

### 2.3. Running the Application

Location of command execution: Root directory of this repository

| Command | Description |
|-----------|-----------|
| `docker compose up` | Run the container(s) |
| `docker compose up -d` | Run container(s) in detached mode |
| `docker compose down` | Stop the container(s) |
| `docker exec ow-test-backend python -m pytest` | Run tests in docker backend container |


## Task Details

### Thought Process

#### 1. Requirement Analysis

##### 1.1. Potentially Ambiguous Requirements and Assumptions

> If the `reports/:id` endpoint returns a HTTP 404 status code for a given report_id you must fall back to the calculation method outlined below.

The requirement did not state whether the `/usage` endpoint should return HTTP error code when the report endpoint returns a HTTP error code other than HTTP 404. Assume that it should raise HTTP 500 error code. Retry could be implemented if there is sufficient time left after essential functions implementation.


##### 1.2. Decision on a List of Features within Time Limit

*Essential TODO List:*
- Routes
  - [x] GET '/'
  - [x] GET '/usage'
- Models
  - [x] API Response from other services
    - Copilot Message
    - Copilot Report
  - [x] `/usage` API Response:
    - Copilot Usage
- HTTP Client to query upstream services
   - [x] Get messages
   - [x] Get reports by ID
- [x] Credit usage calculation service
- Tests
  - [x] Unit Tests for usage calculation service
  - [x] Integration Tests for HTTP client service
  - [ ] Integration Tests for `/usage` API

*Optional TODO List:*
- [ ] Logging
- [ ] Retry with exponential backoff for querying upstream services
- [ ] API versioning
- [ ] Mock response in tests to avoid external service calls


#### 2. Choice of Framework / Libraries

- `FastAPI` framework was chosen to build API endpoints, since it is easy to use and fast. One of its strength over Flask is the integration with `pydantic` to validate request body and response body of the API endpoints. Also it supports asynchronous requests out of the box.
- `HTTPX` provides a client that can be used to query upstream services. It also has support for retries with exponential backoff and mocking responses in tests.
- `pytest` was chosen as a testing framework to run unit, integration and functional tests. It also has support for mocking responses in tests.
